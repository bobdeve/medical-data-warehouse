Below is a concise rubric outline with the exact metric keys required:

Data Collection Mechanism
• Evaluate how well raw Telegram data and images are scraped, stored, and partitioned in the data lake.
• Assess logging and incremental data handling.

API Endpoint Development
• Check for clear, well-documented FastAPI endpoints addressing the business questions.
• Confirm proper use of Pydantic schemas for data validation.

Repository Organization and Security
• Look for a reproducible project structure, including Git initialization, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and requirements.txt.
• Verify that secrets in the .env file are secured and excluded using .gitignore.

Data Transformation Workflow
• Assess the setup and execution of dbt projects transforming raw data into staging and mart models.
• Ensure built-in tests and documentation (dbt docs) are effectively implemented.

Machine Learning Integration
• Evaluate the integration of YOLOv8 for image object detection.
• Confirm that detection results are correctly loaded into a new fact table and linked to core data models.

### 🪵 Logging and Incremental Loading
- Implemented logging to track progress and errors.
- Only new messages/images are downloaded using `message_id` tracking to avoid redundancy.

---

## ✅ Task 2 – API Endpoint Development

### 🚀 FastAPI Setup
- Built RESTful APIs using **FastAPI** to expose key insights and metrics.

### 🔍 Key Endpoints
- `/api/channels`: List available Telegram channels.
- `/api/channels/{channel_id}/activity`: View message counts over time.
- `/api/channels/{channel_id}/detections`: Fetch detected image objects per channel.

### 📦 Pydantic Schemas
- All request/response models are defined using **Pydantic** for strong type validation and data integrity.

---

## ✅ Task 3 – Repository Organization and Security

### 📁 Project Structure

medical-data-warehouse/
├── api/ # FastAPI endpoints
├── dbt/ # dbt models and configs
├── dagster_pipeline/ # Dagster orchestrations
├── notebooks/ # Exploratory and training notebooks
├── data_lake/ # Raw and processed data
├── .env # Secrets and config variables
├── .gitignore # Hides .env and other sensitive data
├── Dockerfile # Container configuration
├── docker-compose.yml # Stack orchestration
└── requirements.txt # Python dependencies


### 🔒 Secrets Management
- `.env` file stores sensitive info like:
  - `TELE_API_ID`, `TELE_API_HASH`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`
- `.env` is secured via `.gitignore` and **never pushed** to GitHub.

---

## ✅ Task 4 – Data Transformation Workflow

### 🛠️ dbt Setup
- Raw Telegram data is transformed into structured fact and dimension tables using `dbt`.

### ✨ Key dbt Models
- `stg_telegram_messages.sql`: Stage the raw Telegram messages.
- `dim_channels.sql`: Create channel dimension.
- `fct_messages.sql`: Fact table for Telegram messages.
- `fct_image_detections.sql`: Fact table for YOLO detections.

### ✅ dbt Tests and Docs
- Built-in dbt **schema tests**: `unique`, `not_null`, and `relationships`.
- **dbt docs** generated using:

dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve


---

## ✅ Task 5 – Pipeline Orchestration

### ⚙️ Dagster Setup
- Installed Dagster using:
```bash
pip install dagster dagster-webserver

🧩 Defined Dagster Job
Converted the logic of run_pipeline.sh into a Dagster job with the following ops:

scrape_telegram_data: Pull raw messages and images.

load_raw_to_postgres: Store data in PostgreSQL.

run_dbt_transformations: Run dbt models.

run_yolo_enrichment: Detect and load image objects.


🖥️ Launching the Dagster UI

dagster dev


Visit http://127.0.0.1:3000 to interact with the pipeline.

⏰ Scheduling with Dagster
Set up schedules to run the pipeline daily using Dagster's @schedule decorator and cron expressions.

💡 Rubric Mapping
Metric Key	Implementation Summary
Data Collection Mechanism	Telethon scraper with logging, message_id tracking, image partitioning in data lake
API Endpoint Development	FastAPI with documented endpoints and validated Pydantic schemas
Repository & Security	Clean structure, Docker-ready, secrets in .env, .gitignore in place
Data Transformation Workflow	dbt staging/marts, with tests and generated documentation
Machine Learning Integration	YOLOv8 used for object detection; results loaded into fact tables
Pipeline Orchestration	Dagster-based ops, job, schedule, and local web UI
