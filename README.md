🏥 Medical Data Warehouse - Telegram Product Intelligence
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to build a robust data pipeline that extracts, transforms, and enriches product and health-related information shared via Telegram messages. Using a modern data stack (PostgreSQL, dbt, YOLOv8, Docker, etc.), it powers downstream analytics by delivering clean, enriched, and queryable data.

✅ Tasks Implemented:

Scraping raw data from Telegram

Transforming it via dbt (dimensional modeling)

Enriching visual data using YOLOv8 for object detection

⚙️ Project Structure & Reproducible Environment
✅ Reproducibility Highlights:
Git Repository initialized with modular folder structure.

requirements.txt to manage Python dependencies (e.g., telethon, psycopg2, dbt, ultralytics).

Docker support via:

Dockerfile: Defines the Python environment.

docker-compose.yml: Connects services like PostgreSQL and dbt.

.env file handles secrets and configuration (e.g., Telegram API keys, DB credentials).

📥 Raw Data Collection from Telegram (Task 1)
✅ Scraping Highlights:
Uses Telethon API to connect to Telegram and collect messages.

Supports scraping both text and images from specified channels.

All messages stored as raw JSON files, organized by date and channel:

bash
Copy
Edit
data/raw/chemed123/2024-07-13.json
data/raw/lobelia4cosmetics/2024-07-13.json
✅ Logging & Error Handling:
Errors (e.g., media not found) are gracefully handled and logged.

Logs include scraping duration, success count, and failures for traceability.

🧱 DBT Data Warehouse (Task 2)
✅ dbt Project Highlights:
Connection established to PostgreSQL via profiles.yml.

Source models load raw JSON data into stg_telegram_messages.

Dimensional modeling with:

dim_channels

dim_dates

fct_messages

Star schema implemented for efficient querying and dashboarding.

✅ Data Tests:
Primary key and not-null assertions (13+ tests).

All critical models covered with unique and not_null checks.

Example:

tests:
  - not_null:
      column_name: message_id
  - unique:
      column_name: message_id

🧠 Image Enrichment with YOLOv8 (Task 3)
✅ Computer Vision Integration:
Scans images using Ultralytics YOLOv8 pre-trained model.

Extracts:

Detected object class (person, bottle, banana, etc.)

Confidence score (0–1)

Human-readable label using COCO class names

✅ Output Table: fct_image_detections
Linked to fct_messages via message_id

Columns:

image_path, object_class, confidence_score, object_label

Sample Output:

message_id	object_class	confidence_score	object_label
23123	0	0.68	person

📌 Future Improvements
Link image_path more robustly with message metadata

Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions for dbt run + test

Optimize YOLO batch inference for speed

Add dashboard layer via Metabase or Superset
